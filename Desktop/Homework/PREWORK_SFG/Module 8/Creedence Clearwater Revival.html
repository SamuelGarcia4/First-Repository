        <p>Creedence Clearwater Revival, refered to as Creedence or CCR, was one of the greatest american rockbands of the 60's and early 70's. Their music encompasses many different forms of rock including roots rock, swamp rock, and blues rock. Even though they are from the San Francisco Bay area, they play in a Sothern rock style often refering to bayuos, catfish, and the Mississippi River in their lyrics. They also had some political and socially conscious lyrics about things like the Vietnam War. They played at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. </p>
